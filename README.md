# Smart_Water_Pump_Switch

Promoting global sustainability by conserving power and reducing water wastage is paramount. "Automatic Water Pump Switch with Level Indicator" project aims to empower households to make a meaningful contribution towards minimizing both power and water waste. This solution ensures that the water pump switches off before overflowing, switches on when water reaches a specified low level, and provides a real-time display of the tank's current water level.

## The Product Architecture

The automatic water pump switch consists of three main sub-systems.
  1. **Regulated DC power supply**
  2. **Automatic water pump switch**
  3. **Water level indicator**
